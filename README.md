# Tetris.

## Background and Overview

Tetris is a tile matching puzzle game. Each turn, the player receives a random puzzle piece, and the goal is to arrange the pieces so that a row on the board is completely occupied and thus clears from the board. Bonus points are given for clearing multiple rows at the same time. The game is over when the player is unable to clear any more rows.


## Functionality and MVP
In Tetris, players will be able to:
* See instructions for the game.
* Click to start the game when ready.
* See the game score.
* Use the keyboard to move and rotate puzzle pieces.


## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen. The player's board will be displayed on the left. The next puzzle piece and the score will be displayed on the right.
